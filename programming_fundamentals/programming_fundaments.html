        <h2 class="text-center mt-3 mb-3">Introduction to programming</h2>
        <hr class="mt-4 mb-4"/>
        <p>In this chapter will cover different topics of programming like : </p>
            <ul class="fs-6">
                <li>What is programming?</li>
                <li>The different types of programming languages.</li>
                <li>The basic elements of a computer program.</li>
                <li>Useful software and different tools for developers.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">What is programming?</h3>
        <hr class="mt-4 mb-4"/>
        <p>Programming also known as coding is the process of writing instruction to a device such as : computers / mobile device. This instrutions are written in a programming language, which is then interpreted by the device. These set of instructions are also called : <em>program</em>, <em>application</em> or <em>computer program</em>.</p>
        <p>A computer program can be anything what is written in code, like : websites, games, phone applications, etc. The device that you're currently reading this lesson with is a running website to print it on your screen.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-5">Programming Languages</h3>
        <hr class="mt-4 mb-4"/>
        <p>The main purpose of a programming language is : for developers to build intructions to send to a device. Devices only can understand binary ( 1s and 0s ), and for most developers that's not a very effcinet way to comunicate. Programming languages are a vehicle for communication between humans and computers.</p>
        <p>Programming languages come in different formats and may serve different purposes. For example, JavaScript is primarily used for web appications, white Bash is primarily used for operating systems ( OS ).</p>
        <p><em>Low-level languages</em> typically require  fewer steps than <em>high level languages</em> for a device to interpret instructions. However, what makes high level languages popupar is their readability and support.</p>
        <p>The following code illustrates the difference bewteen a high level language ( JavaScript ) and low level language with ARM assembly code.</p>
        <p>JavaScript example:</p>
        <pre>
  let number = 10
  let n1 = 0, n2 = 1, nextTerm;
    for (let i = 1; i &lt;= number; i++) {
      console.log(n1);
      nextTerm = n1 + n2;
      n1 = n2;
      n2 = nextTerm;
    }
      </pre>
      <p>Assembly example:</p>
        <pre>
    area ascen,code,readonly
    entry
    code32
    adr r0,thumb+1
    bx r0
    code16 
  thumb
    mov r0,#00
    sub r0,r0,#01
    mov r1,#01
    mov r4,#10
    ldr r2,=0x40000000
  back add r0,r1
    str r0,[r2]
    add r2,#04
    mov r3,r0
    mov r0,r1
    mov r1,r3
    sub r4,#01
    cmp r4,#00
    bne back
    end
      </pre>
      <p>Both example are printing a Fibonacci sequence up to 10.</p>
      <p>A Fibonacci sequence is defined as a set of numbers such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-5">The basic elements of a computer program</h3>
      <hr class="mt-4 mb-4"/>
      <p class="mb-3">The basic building blocks of any computer program can be broken down into these core components:</p>
      <ul class="mt-2">
        <li><p><span class="fw-bold">Instrunctions (Statements) : </span>These are the fundamental lines of code that
          tell the computer what to do. Each statement performs a specific action, like assigning a value to a variable,
          performing a calculation, or checking a condition. Imagine them like tiny steps in a recepie - follow them one
          by one and you get the desire outcome.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><p><span class="fw-bold">Variables : </span> These act like named containers that store data the program uses 
          during it's execution. They can hold numbers, text or even more complex things. Think of them as labeled boxes where
          you can store ingredients (data) for your recepie (program).
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><p><span class="fw-bold">Operators : </span> These are  symbols that manipulate data. They perform mathematical
          operations (+, -, *, /) or comparisons (==, !=, &lt;, &gt;). Just like in math, operators combine or modify values in our program.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><p><span class="fw-bold">Control Flow : </span> This refers to the way the program executes it's instructions. 
          Programs don't just blindly follow a straight line - they can make decisons based on conditions and repeat actions using loops.
           Control flow structures like if-statements, for-loops, and while-loops allow your program to be flexibile and adapt.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><p><span class="fw-bold">Functions : </span> These are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They can take
          inputs ( data ) and produce output ( results ). Think of them as sub-recepies within your main recepie. You can create a function to perform a specific
          task ( washing dishes ) and call it from your main recipie ( cooking dinner ) multiple times.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><p><span class="fw-bold">Comments : </span> These are lines of text ignored by the computer but are meant for human readers.
           They explain what the code is doing, making it easier to understand and maintain. Comments are like helpful notes you write in 
           your recepie book to explain specific steps or substitutions.
        </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">These basic elements are like the building blocks of Legos - you can combine them in many ways to create a wide variety of programs, 
        from simple calculatos to complex games or simulations.
      </p>
